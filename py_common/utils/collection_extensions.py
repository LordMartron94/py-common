        """Split an iterable into groups based on a predicate function.

        Args:
            predicate (callable): A predicate function that takes two arguments (before and after)
                and returns a boolean value indicating whether to split the group at that point.
            items (iterable): The iterable to split into groups.

        Yields:
            list: A list containing consecutive elements from the input iterable 'items' 
                where the predicate function 'pred' returns False for each consecutive pair 
                of elements in the yielded list.

        Example:
            Consider an iterable of integers 'numbers' and a predicate function 'is_even'
            that returns True if the current number and the next number are both even.
            We can use split_between to group consecutive even numbers:

            >>> numbers = [2, 4, 6, 3, 8, 10, 7, 9, 12]
            >>> def is_even(before, after):
            ...     return before % 2 == 0 and after % 2 == 0
            ...
            >>> list(split_between(is_even, numbers))
            [[2, 4, 6], [8, 10], [12]]
